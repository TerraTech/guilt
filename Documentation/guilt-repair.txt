NAME

guilt-repair - Repair the repository state

SYNOPSIS
--------
include::usage-guilt-repair.txt[]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Resets the repository state by reseting the HEAD to what's believed to be
the proper commit, and reseting the applied stack. The end result should be
a repository with no patches applied.

WARNING: Running this command may result in commits and working directory
changes being lost. You may want to create a new reference (tag or branch)
to the original HEAD before using guilt-repair.

-f::
	Force repair. Without this option, guilt-repair aborts.
