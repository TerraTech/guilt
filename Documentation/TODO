Misc Bugs/Enhancements:
=======================

Here are some things I want to do one of these days...

- Fix push/pop regression tests to cover --all/multi-patch cases
- Add more regression tests
- Allow 'guilt foo' in addition to 'guilt-foo'
- Grab the From: line out of the patch and use that as author string
- guilt-delete should allow the user to delete the patch file as well
- Make sh a requirement, not bash
