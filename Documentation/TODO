Misc Bugs/Enhancements:
=======================

Here are some things I want to do one of these days...

- Allow 'gq foo' in addition to 'gq-foo'
- Grab the From: line out of the patch and use that as author string
- gq-delete should allow the user to delete the patch file as well
- Make sh a requirement, not bash
